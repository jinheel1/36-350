cat("Hello, aliens. Rather than ask questions like where you come from or why you're here, 
I wanna ask which of our fictional works managed to portray your particular race the closest.
Considering the fact we're not dying horribly by your doing right now, I'd guess you're not of
Ridley Scott's Aliens or DC's Brainiac and what have you. Mass Effect or Star Wars would be pretty
cool, since that'd mean humans could eventually integrate with the intergalactic happenings. Saiyans
would be rough, but then millions of little kids could finally live out their dreams of seeing
Super Saiyans. Whatever the case, I'm excited to hear your thoughts. As a side note, I'm amazed that
my planet chose me to talk to you. Toodles!")
